                        <div class=images-characters><img src=assets/genshin-impact-xiao.png alt="Xiao Chibi" class=featured-image-xiao> <img src=assets/genshin-impact-fischl.png alt="Fischl Chibi" class=featured-image-fischl> <img src=assets/genshin-impact-beidou.png alt="Beidou Chibi" class=featured-image-beidou> <img src=assets/genshin-impact-kazuha.png alt="Kazuha Chibi" class=featured-image-kazuha></div>
                        <h3><b>Xiao's Mask Has Meaning</b></h3>
                        <p>Xiao’s Yaksha mask is inspired by <b>Nuo opera masks</b> from Chinese culture. His mask also resembles a <b>qilin</b>, a mythical creature known for protecting the innocent.</p><br>
                        <h3><b>Fischl’s "Ravenspeak" is Self-Taught</b></h3>
                        <p>Unlike Collei (who can actually talk to animals with Dendro powers), Fischl’s "<b>Ozian language</b>" is entirely made-up by her. Oz just plays along.</p><br>
                        <h3><b>Beidou Once Fought a Sea Monster Alone</b></h3>
                        <p>Beidou <b>killed the sea monster Haishan by herself</b> using nothing but her greatsword and Electro Vision, earning the title <b>"Uncrowned Lord of the Ocean."</b></p><br>
                        <h3><b>Kazuha’s Vision Story is Unique</b></h3>
                        <p>Kazuha’s vision didn’t come to him normally. It <b>belonged to his deceased friend</b>, and it resonated with him after their duel. His friend's willpower was so strong that the vision <b>reignited after their death</b>.</p>
